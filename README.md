# 🔐 Rail Fence Cipher Cryptanalysis (Python)

An educational **Python implementation of Rail Fence Cipher brute-force cryptanalysis.**

This project demonstrates how classical transposition ciphers can be broken using systematic rail reconstruction and exhaustive search.

It is designed strictly as a **learning and academic project** to understand the structural weaknesses of classical ciphers — not as a real-world attack tool.

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 Full Brute-Force Rail Search
- Tests all possible rail values from `2` to `n-1`
- Displays all possible plaintext candidates
- Reconstructs zigzag pattern for each rail count

### 🔁 Zigzag Pattern Reconstruction
- Dynamically marks rail positions
- Fills matrix row-wise using ciphertext
- Re-traverses zigzag pattern to rebuild plaintext

### 🧠 Structural Cryptanalysis Focus
- Demonstrates transposition cipher weakness
- Shows how unknown key (rail count) can be recovered
- Reinforces matrix-based algorithmic thinking

### 🧮 Educational Focus
- Clean modular Python functions
- Clear separation between:
  - Decryption logic
  - Brute-force controller
- CLI-based execution

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShakalBhau0001/rail-fence-cipher-cryptanalysis-python.git
```

### 2️⃣ Navigate to the project folder
```bash
cd rail-fence-cipher-cryptanalysis-python
```

### 3️⃣ Run the program
```bash
python app.py
```

### 4️⃣ Enter Cipher Text
- Provide any Rail Fence encrypted message (without spaces)
- View all possible plaintext outputs for different rail values
- Identify the most meaningful English result

---

## 🔎 Example

```bash
Enter ciphertext: HOLELWRDLO

--- Brute Force Results ---

Rails = 2 → HWORLDELLO
Rails = 3 → HELLOWORLD
Rails = 4 → HLWLREOLDO
...
```

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Does not automatically score English likelihood
- Outputs all possible rail reconstructions
- Manual inspection required to identify correct plaintext
- Inefficient for very large inputs (O(n²) behavior)
- CLI-based interaction only

---

## 🌟 Future Improvements
- Rank most probable plaintext automatically
- Add English-likelihood scoring system
- Add file input support
- Integrate into a Classical Crypto Toolkit
- Convert into reusable Python module
- Add visualization of zigzag pattern
